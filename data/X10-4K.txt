Safety Precautions
Please read the following Safety Precautions before you start using the projector.
•	Keep this user guide in a safe place for later reference.
•	Read all warnings and follow all instructions.
•	Allow at least 20“ (50 cm) clearance around the projector to ensure proper
ventilation.
•	Place the projector in a well-ventilated area. Do not place anything on the projector that prevents heat dissipation.
•	Do not place the projector on an uneven or unstable surface. The projector may fall over, causing personal injury or projector malfunction.
•	Do not use if the projector is tilted at an angle of more than 10° degrees left or right, nor at an angle of more than 15° degrees forwards or backwards.
•	Do not look straight at the projector lens during operation. The intense light
beam may damage your eyes.
•	Always open the lens shutter or remove the lens cap when the projector lamp is
on.
•	Do not block the projection lens with any objects when the projector is under operation as this could cause objects to become heated and deformed or even cause a fire.
•	The lamp becomes extremely hot during operation. Allow the projector to cool for approximately 45 minutes prior to removing the lamp assembly for replacement.
•	Do not use lamps beyond the rated lamp life. Excessive use of lamps beyond the
rated life could cause them to break on rare occasions.
•	Never replace the lamp assembly or any electronic component unless the projector is unplugged.
•	Do not attempt to disassemble the projector. There are dangerous high voltages
inside which may cause death if you should come into contact with live parts.
•	When moving the projector, be careful not to drop or bump the projector on anything.
•	Do not place any heavy objects on the projector or connection cables.
•	Do not stand the projector on end vertically. Doing so may cause the projector to fall over, causing personal injury or projector malfunction.
•	Avoid exposing the projector to direct sunlight or other sources of sustained heat. Do not install near any heat sources such as radiators, heat registers, stoves, or other devices (including amplifiers) that may increase the temperature of the projector to dangerous levels.
 
•	Do not place liquids near or on the projector. Liquids spilled into the projector may cause it to fail. If the projector does become wet, disconnect it from the power supply and call your local service center to have the projector serviced.
•	When the projector is under operation, you may sense some heated air and odor from its ventilation grill. It is a normal operation and not a defect.
•	Do not attempt to circumvent the safety provisions of the polarized or grounding-type plug. A polarized plug has two blades with one wider than the other. A grounding-type plug has two blades and a third grounding prong. The wide and third blade are provided for your safety. If the plug does not fit into your outlet, obtain an adapter and do not attempt to force the plug into the outlet.
•	When connecting to a power outlet, DO NOT remove the grounding prong. Please ensure grounding prongs are NEVER REMOVED.
•	Protect the power cord from being treaded upon or pinched, particularly at the
plug, and at the point where it emerges from the projector.
•	In some countries, the voltage is NOT stable. This projector is designed to operate safely within a voltage between 100 to 240 volts AC, but could fail if power cuts or surges of ±10 volts occur. In areas where voltage may fluctuate or cut out, it is recommended that you connect your projector through a power stabilizer, surge protector, or uninterruptable power supply (UPS).
•	If smoke, an abnormal noise, or a strange odor is present, immediately switch the projector off and call your dealer or ViewSonic®. It is dangerous to continue using the projector.
•	Use only attachments/accessories specified by the manufacturer.
•	Disconnect the power cord from the AC outlet if the projector is not being used for a long period of time.
•	Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel.

CAUTION: Possibly hazardous optical radiation is emitted from this product. As with any bright light source, do not stare into the beam, RG2 IEC 62471- 5:2015
 
Safety Precautions - Ceiling Mounting
Please read the following Safety Precautions before you start using the projector.
If you intend to mount the projector on the ceiling, it is strongly recommended that you use a proper fitting projector ceiling mount kit and that you ensure it is securely and safely installed.
If you use an inappropriate projector ceiling mount kit, there is a safety risk that the projector may fall from the ceiling due to an improper attachment through the use of the wrong gauge or length screws.
You can purchase a projector ceiling mount kit from the place you purchased your projector.

Menu Option	Description
Color Mode	The projector is preset with several predefined picture modes so that you can choose one to suit your operating environment and input signal.
Brightest
Maximizes the brightness of the projected image. This mode is suitable for environments where extra-high brightness is required, i.e. well-lit rooms.
TV
Optimized for viewing sports in well-lit environments.
Gaming
Designed for playing video games.
Movie
Appropriate for colorful movies, video clips from digital cameras, or DVs through the PC input. Best for low-light environments.
User 1/User 2
Recalls the customized user settings.
Brightness	The higher the value, the brighter the image. Lower
values will result in a darker image.

 	 	 

 	   	 
Contrast	Use this to set the peak white level after you have previously adjusted the Brightness setting to suit your selected input and viewing environment.
 
Menu Option	Description
Color Temp	Select the color temperature setting.
•	6500K: Maintains normal white coloring.
•	7500K: A higher, cooler color temperature than 6500K.
•	9300K: The highest color temperature; makes the image appear the most bluish-white.
•	User Color: Adjust red, green, and blue values as desired.
Tint	The higher the value, the more greenish the picture becomes. The lower the value, the more reddish the picture becomes.
Saturation	Refers to the amount of that color in a video picture. Lower settings produce less saturated colors; in fact, a setting of “0” removes that color from the image entirely. If the saturation is too high, that color will be overpowering and unrealistic.
Sharpness	A high value results in a sharper picture; a low value
softens the picture.
Gamma	Reflects the relationship between input source and
picture brightness.
 
Menu Option	Description
Color Management	Only in permanent installations with controlled lighting levels such as: boardrooms, lecture halls, or home theaters should Color Management be considered.

Menu Option	Description
Aspect Ratio	The Aspect Ratio is the ratio of the image width to the image height. With the advent of digital signal processing, digital display devices, like this projector, can dynamically stretch and scale the image output to a different aspect than that of the image input signal.
NOTE: Only supports HDMI/USB-C signal input.

 
Auto
Scales an image proportionally to fit the projector’s native resolution in its horizontal width. This is suitable for the incoming image which is neither 4:3 nor 16:9 and you want to make the most use of the screen without altering the image’s aspect ratio.
4:3
Scales an image so that it is displayed in the center of the screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This is most suitable for 4:3 images like computer monitors, standard definition TV, and 4:3 aspect DVD movies, as it displays them without aspect alteration.
 
Menu Option	Description
Aspect Ratio	16:9
Scales an image so that it is displayed in the center of the screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio. This is most suitable for images which are already in a 16:9 aspect, like high definition TV.
16:10
Scales an image so that it is displayed in the center of the screen with a 16:10 aspect ratio. This is most suitable for images which are already in a 16:10 aspect.
Native
Projects the image as its original resolution and resizes it to fit within the display area. For input signals with lower resolutions, the projected image will be displayed in its original size.
HDR	The projector supports HDR imaging. It can automatically detect the dynamic range of the source from the HDMI 1 & HDMI 2 ports, and optimize settings to reproduce contents under a wide range of light conditions.
EOTF	Automatically adjusts the brightness levels of your image according to the input source. You can also manually select a brightness level to display better picture quality.
NOTE: This function is not available when SDR is selected in the HDR menu.
Frame
Interpolation	Smooths the picture quality of high speed moving objects. This is especially for users who enjoy fast paced sporting events.
HDMI Settings	Range
Select a suitable color range according to the color range
setting of the connected output device.
•	Full: Sets the color range from 0~255.
•	Limited: Sets the color range from 15~235
•	Auto: Sets the projector to detect the range of the input
signal automatically.

CAUTION: Never use wax, alcohol, benzene, thinner, or other chemical
detergents.

•	Remove the batteries from the remote control.
•	Pack the projector in its original packaging or equivalent.
Disclaimer
•	ViewSonic® does not recommend the use of any ammonia or alcohol-based cleaners on the lens or case. Some chemical cleaners have been reported to damage the lens and/or case of the projector.
